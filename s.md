Used with the browser plug-in [TwExportly](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/hbibehafoapglhcgfhlpifagloecmhfh), the plug-in can export tweets posted by any Twitter account to a csv file, but the pictures and videos in it are only links. This python script can download media files in the csv file. The script can only process one csv file at a time. Put the script and the csv file in the same folder. There should be no other csv files in this folder. Run the py script. Download media files to separate folders by tweet, that is, the files of one tweet are in one folder, and the folder name is the corresponding row number in the csv file.
